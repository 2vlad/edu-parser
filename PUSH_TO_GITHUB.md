# 📤 Push to GitHub Instructions

## Current Status
✅ All changes committed locally (38 files)
❌ No GitHub remote configured

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository (if not exists)
Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:
- Repository name: `edu-parser`
- Description: "Automated scraping system for university admission data"
- Private/Public: Your choice
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### 2. Add Remote and Push

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edu-parser.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/edu-parser.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Actions

After pushing, check:
- Go to your repo on GitHub
- Click "Actions" tab
- You should see the workflows we created:
  - Health Check
  - Monitor Deployment
  - Run Scrapers (cron)

### 4. Set GitHub Secrets

Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions, add:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_KEY`

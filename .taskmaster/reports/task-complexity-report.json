			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into: 1) Create directory structure with all required folders and __init__.py files, 2) Create requirements.txt with all dependencies and versions, 3) Create .env.example with template variables and documentation, 4) Configure .gitignore for Python projects including common patterns",
			"reasoning": "Basic project setup with straightforward directory creation and dependency management. Complexity comes from ensuring proper Python package structure and environment configuration."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down database configuration into: 1) Connect to Supabase dashboard and create new project if needed, 2) Execute SQL to create applicant_counts table with all constraints and indexes, 3) Execute SQL to create scrapers_config table, 4) Insert initial scraper configuration data for all universities, 5) Verify database connectivity from Python and test CRUD operations",
			"reasoning": "Requires understanding of PostgreSQL schema design, Supabase platform specifics, and proper indexing strategies. Multiple tables with relationships and constraints add moderate complexity."

			"expansionPrompt": "Break down storage module into: 1) Implement Storage class initialization with Supabase client setup, 2) Implement save_result method with proper error handling and data validation, 3) Implement get_enabled_scrapers method with filtering logic, 4) Add get_today_results method for monitoring purposes, 5) Implement batch_save_results for performance optimization, 6) Add comprehensive unit tests with mocked Supabase client",
			"reasoning": "Core module requiring robust error handling, database transaction management, and proper abstraction. Needs consideration of connection pooling, retry logic, and data validation."

			"taskId": 4,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down HSE scraper into: 1) Implement Excel file download with retry logic and timeout handling, 2) Parse Excel structure to understand column mappings, 3) Implement program search logic with fuzzy matching for program names, 4) Extract count data with proper type conversion and validation, 5) Handle all error cases including network failures and missing data, 6) Create unit tests with sample Excel data",
			"reasoning": "Parsing Excel files from external sources requires handling various edge cases, network issues, and data format variations. The xlrd engine adds compatibility complexity."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down MIPT scraper into: 1) Implement HTML fetching with proper headers and timeout configuration, 2) Parse HTML to locate R19 class elements reliably, 3) Extract data-index attribute with validation and edge case handling, 4) Implement the +1 calculation logic with bounds checking, 5) Add comprehensive error handling for malformed HTML and missing elements",
			"reasoning": "HTML scraping with specific class targeting requires careful DOM navigation and handling of potential HTML structure changes. The data-index calculation adds unique logic."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down MEPhI scraper into: 1) Implement HTML fetching with authentication handling if needed, 2) Parse HTML to locate trPosBen elements with BeautifulSoup, 3) Navigate to nested pos class within table structure, 4) Extract and validate position numbers with type conversion, 5) Handle edge cases like empty tables or changed HTML structure",
			"reasoning": "Similar complexity to MIPT scraper but with different HTML structure patterns. Requires nested element navigation and robust error handling for DOM changes."

			"taskId": 7,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down registry and runner into: 1) Implement ScraperRegistry with dynamic module loading logic, 2) Add scraper validation and health checking methods, 3) Implement ScraperRunner with thread pool configuration, 4) Add timeout handling and graceful shutdown for long-running scrapers, 5) Implement result aggregation and error reporting, 6) Add metrics collection for scraper performance, 7) Create integration tests for concurrent execution",
			"reasoning": "Complex module requiring dynamic imports, concurrent execution management, and robust error isolation. Thread pool management and graceful error handling add significant complexity."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down main entry point into: 1) Set up comprehensive logging configuration with rotation, 2) Implement main orchestration logic with proper initialization order, 3) Add error aggregation and reporting logic, 4) Implement exit code handling for cron job monitoring, 5) Create local testing script with mock data",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward orchestration logic but requires careful consideration of logging, error handling, and exit codes for production cron job monitoring."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down Railway deployment into: 1) Create and test railway.json configuration locally, 2) Configure nixpacks.toml for Python dependencies and system packages, 3) Set up Railway project and connect GitHub repository, 4) Configure environment variables in Railway dashboard, 5) Set up cron schedule and test execution, 6) Implement deployment monitoring and rollback procedures",
			"reasoning": "Deployment configuration requires understanding of Railway platform, Nixpacks build system, and cron scheduling. Environment variable management and monitoring setup add complexity."
